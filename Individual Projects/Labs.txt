Projects:
-Implement a representation of an OS scheduling simulation. 

Write a script that simulates an operating system scheduler (5 stage). You can represent processes via numbers which represent a PID (i.e. you don’t need to have real processes). You must randomize the return time and the i/o need of each process. You can implement any scheduling algorithm of your choice. Can be written in any language you want. For the scheduling algorithm it is recommended that you go to section 7 of ostep. Ask the board team in github or the remind if you need anything. 

-Create a winapi script

Must integrate at least 3 winapi functions. Write a simple script that integrates winapi for windows. Using non gui is recommended. If you want to learn more about winapi in asm then you should wait for the winapi section of the asm to go. Otherwise there should be a winapi tutorial posted soon. Writing in C/asm is recommended. Ask the board team in github or the remind if you need anything. 

-Create a bat/bash file

(FOR LINUX)
Write a bash script that preforms a system hardening routine of your choice. The script much 1: alter the PAM. 2: The file must update OpenSSH and Sytemd. 3: The file must remove Apache applications. 4: The file must disable root login with SSH.

Project 
-Implement a parallelism algorithm. 

Implement an algorithm that targets instructions, threads or data and uses an existing optimizing algorithm. It can be written on top of an existing verilog project or a new implementation of a theoretical parallelism algorithm in a programming language. Parallelism algorithms to be implemented and github projects to build on will be supplied in time. Request this lab and we will give it to you in a specified time frame.

-Make an opcode reader. 

Make a file with custom opcodes / operands (1 byte) and write a script that interprets it. It must read at least 3 different opcodes with different operands. The opcode reader can be simple and only handle moving into registers for example. The specifications of your working code should specify with comments. Can be written in any language. You cannot use the example opcode/operand.
	Example of opcode/operand - 1 (mov instruction) 0 (represent a register) 1 ( represent a number) 

-Make a threading script. 

Implement a simple algorithm that implements threading such as multiplying two arrays of numbers together. The threading api is discussed in section 27 of ostep. There will be a threading section appended to the extra learning document. Using C is recommended.

Projects:

Make a basic ram system with electrical components

Use electrical components to replicate how ram systems work. You should do your own research into ram and show all of the math involved in making your system. 

Make a program that uses caching a lot. 

Make a program that requires an excess of cache affinity and/or uses a high amount of the cpu cache. It is recommended that you use C or another systems programming language. It is recommended that you google or ai to learn about how to use caching. If you do this then you should research first and then outline what you want to do in your proposal! 

Implement the circuit diagram of nand flash memory. 

Draw out on paper or on your computer a diagram of how cmos circuits would be made in a circuit diagram of nand flash memory. You should explicitly make this as simple as possible. You should research power consumption and delay and write out a plan for how you are thinking of implementing them in your own design. 
ASM
Questions that won’t require looking at fasm manual (slides/doc only): 
-What is your operating system? (easy)
-What is the difference between putting a variable in brackets and leaving a variable on its own (i.e. [variable] or variable)? (easy)
-What is fasm g? (easy)
-How do you make a loop in fasm? (easy)
-What is a different way to mov a variable than mov eax, [memory]? (easy)

Questions that will require looking at fasm manual:
-What is an error code that you may have to deal with when using lodsb? (easy)
-What is a difference between intel and at&t syntax? (easy)
-At what size does windows ask you to use NX to extend your binary into long mode? (medium)
-How do you import a custom dll? (medium)
-What’s the difference between invoke and stdcall? (medium)
-What is the generated file extension of the file generated in the process of assembling a fasm file (IR)? (medium)
-What is the format for the first header of the file generated in the process of assembling a fasm file? (hard)

Projects:
-Prove they can use floats, strings, jumps, and compares without breaking code.

Make a file that integrates floats, strings, unconditional and conditional jumps, and compares. Must be written in asm however it is recommended to write it in fasm. There must be a minimum of 50 lines. For information on this look at the fasm tutorial in the github resources folder.

-Make an atoi algorithm.

An atoi (ascii to integer) algorithm is an algorithm that takes an ascii character into an integer. It is recommended to take a number in quotes (i.e. the ascii value of a number) and translate them into an array of integers. It is highly recommended that you program in C/asm. 

-Make a BCD reader.

Show the BCD reader being used in some way.

-Write your own sha256 hash generator. 

You should first ask about what sha is and how it works before starting this challenge. Implement a program that takes an input and outputs an sha256 hash.
