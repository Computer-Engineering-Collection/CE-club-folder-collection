# CE-club-folder-collection

This is the main repo containing all of the information regarding this club. It is not done yet and there will still be additions.



In the Individual Projects folder you should be able to find folders with all of the projects that you can access. You should send a pull request to your own folder. We will allow you to allow your own pull request to go through in your own folder but you won't be able to do it in other peoples folders. 



In the Resources folder you can find the extra learning document so that you can find an easy starting place to learn specific skills. 



In the slides folder you can find the old slides that we have previously shown before in previous meetings.
