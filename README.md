# CE-club-folder-collection

This is the main repo containing all of the information regarding this club. It is not done yet and there will still be additions.



In the Individual Projects folder you should be able to find folders with all of the projects that you can access. You should send a pull request to your own folder. We will allow you to allow your own pull request to go through in your own folder but you won't be able to do it in other peoples folders.



In the Resources folder you can find the extra learning document so that you can find an easy starting place to learn specific skills.



In the slides folder you can find the old slides that we have previously shown before in previous meetings.



If you have a problem that you want us to help you with then ask us in person it or ask in the remind.



If you want to apply to the board then you should make a pull request of a document called BOARD\_APPLICATION.txt where you will have to give a short paragraph regarding what you have done in the club and why you want to join. You need to have a minimum of 30 points, which are given from doing projects, to apply for a lower board position. 



Note: Anyone (members/people with access) that purposly decides to mess up/screw with this repo will face consequences. GitHub includes logs of whatever yall do.
