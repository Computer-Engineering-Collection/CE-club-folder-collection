In the Individual Projects folder you should be able to find folders with all of the projects that you can access. You should send a pull request to your own folder. Look at the readme to understand the types of projects more. 



In the Resources folder you can find the extra learning document so that you can find an easy starting place to learn specific skills.



In the slides folder you can find the old slides that we have previously shown before in previous meetings.



If you have a problem that you want us to help you with then ask us in person it or ask in the remind.



If you want to apply to the board then you should make a pull request of a document called BOARD\_APPLICATION.txt where you will have to give a short paragraph regarding what you have done in the club and why you want to join. You need to have a minimum of 30 points, which are given from doing projects, to apply for a lower board position.
