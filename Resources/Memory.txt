This is useful for learning more about ram. It is mostly looking into faults (specifically functional ones). For more context faults are defects in the hardware that come during manufacturing. Functional faults are faults that cause the hardware to behave differently than anticipated. There are a ton of faults mentioned in Section 2 if you are interested. Faults can interact with each other to make the designer and tester's life more difficult but this paper doesnâ€™t cover those.
